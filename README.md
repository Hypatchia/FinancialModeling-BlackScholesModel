# Financial Modeling 
* This Project was part of my Master's Degree Class: Stochastic Analysis & Modeling.
## Overview Black Scholes model for Financial Modeling of Returns for a Stock Price.
In the fast-paced world of financial markets, understanding and modeling stock price movements is crucial for making informed investment decisions. 

This project delves into financial data analysis, leveraging Geometric Brownian Motion and the Black-Scholes model to gain insights into stock price returns.
  
### Approach:
* Analyse Time Series Data using Normality Tests, histograms, Correlation Plots (Partial Correlation and AutoCorrelation)...
* Implement geometric Brownian Motion to predict stock prices, a widely-used model in financial mathematics.
* Provide an Estimation model for CRSPR stock - a key player in the biotechnology industry
* Perform simulations for CRSPR stock to understand its behavior under various conditions and market scenarios.
* Simulate the behavior of the ARK ETF GENOMICS, a fund that invests in companies at the forefront of genomics and biotechnology.

### Data Sources
The financial data utilized in this project is primarily sourced from Yahoo Finance.
- The data is for Closing Price of 252 days between 07/06/2021 and 03/06/2022.
- The exact Time Series are in excel files in the directory /data

### Dependencies
To run the code and set up the environment for this project, you will need the following libraries and tools:
- Python 3.7
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Math
- Plotly
- Seaborn
- statmodels

## How to Use
To explore the estimation and simulation of stock price returns using the Black-Scholes model, follow these steps:
* Clone Rpository
  
~~~
git clone [<repository_url>](https://github.com/Hypatchia/FinancialModeling-BlackScholesModel/)https://github.com/Hypatchia/FinancialModeling-BlackScholesModel/
~~~

* Navigate to the project directory.
~~~
 cd FinancialModeling-BlackScholesModel
~~~
* Open and run the Jupyter Notebook to view all the steps of the project.
* Open the scrips to find two main functions:
  * Estimation of Drift & Volatility
  * Simulation of Black Scholes n Model Paths.
 
* For a better understanding of the financial modeling outputs, various plots (acf-pacf) and visualizations are provided in the notebook in addition to comments containing the information (I hope you speak french).
